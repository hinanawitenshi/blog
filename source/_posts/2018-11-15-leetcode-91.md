## Summary

Given a non-empty string `s` containing digits from **0** to 26 with size `n`, determine the total number of ways to decode it by characters 'A' to 'Z'.

## Dynamic Programming

This is a typical dynamic programming problem on a sequence. It is not quite hard to come out the representation of states but, in this problem, several situations need to be considered.

At the beginning, I used `F[i]` to represent the answer of the subsequence from `0` to `i`, both inclusively. However, it was quite hard to determine the relationships between `F[i]` and `F[i - 1]`. Therefore, I came out another representation.

- Let `F[i]` be the answer of the subsequence from `0` to `i`, both inclusively, whose all decode ways are **end by the character at position `i`**.
- Let `G[i]` be the answer of the subsequence from `0` to `i`, both inclusively, whose all decode ways are **end by the character combined by position `i` and `i - 1`**.
- The final answer will be `F[n - 1] + G[n - 1]`.

After that, we need to consider following rules,

1. `F[0] = 1`, `G[0] = 0`.
2. `s[i]` can be along(`s[i] != '0'`), so `F[i] = F[i - 1] + G[i - 1]`.
3. `s[i]` cannot be along, so `F[i] = 0`.
4. `s[i]` can combine with `s[i - 1]`, so `G[i] = F[i - 1]`.
5. `s[i]` cannot combine with `s[i - 1]`, so `G[i] = 0`.
6. There is a `0` in the string, and no other digits can combine with it.
7. `s[0] == '0'`, and the answer is `0`.

Therefore, for any `1 <= i < n`, we may consider two boolean value, `can_along` and `can_combine`. If both of them are false, Rule 6 satisfies and just return `0`.
